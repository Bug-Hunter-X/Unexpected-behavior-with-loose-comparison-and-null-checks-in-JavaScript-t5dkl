# JavaScript Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to loose comparison (==) and null checks.  The issue stems from JavaScript's implicit type coercion, which can lead to unexpected results when comparing values.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function aims to check if a given number `x` is null, negative, or positive. However, due to loose comparison, the `else if (x < 0)` condition might not function as expected when `x` is implicitly coerced to a number.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js`.
3. Run the script using Node.js (or your preferred JavaScript runtime).
4. Observe the unexpected output for `foo(0)`, where you might anticipate -1 but receive 1 instead. 

## Solution

The solution involves using strict comparison (===) instead of loose comparison (==) to avoid implicit type coercion and ensure accurate null checks. The corrected code can be found in `bugSolution.js`

## Lessons Learned

- Always prefer strict comparison (===) over loose comparison (==) in JavaScript, especially when working with null, undefined, or other potentially coerced values.
- Be aware of JavaScript's type coercion rules and potential side effects.  Understanding these implicit type conversions is crucial for writing robust and error-free code.
